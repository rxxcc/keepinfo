# Contacts App <i>(Backend)</i>

Run `bash run.sh` in your terminal

If my any chance you want to debug this application using `Delve` on VSCode, there's a template you can easily add to the `.vscode` file you'll create - check the `debug.example.json` for it. 

Would definitely add more info as times goes on.

Arigato, nakama!
